# PyPep_Toolbox

**PyPep toolbox** includes the basic yet important sequence tools that help the researchers to formulate within stipulated time.It includes operations like-
- addition
- multiplying with an integer
- counting of amino acids 
- overlapping and non-overlapping subsequences
- molecular weight
- charge at a given pH, etc.
and all these embedded to the **sequencer** which outputs for each calculated outputs from the given inputs.

There are two parts - **CLI toolbox and GUI toolbox.**
- For nerdy experience, pypep-cli provides a high-level commandline interface for the peptide sequence management system. 
- For a decent gui experience, pypep-gui can be used for easy understanding and handling of the data. It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized laboratory tools like spectrophotometer and others.
